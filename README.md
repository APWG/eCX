# ecx-code

<h2>Overview</h2>
At the eCrime 2017 conference in Scottsdale, the APWG Steering Committee agreed to create a GitHub respository where APWG Members and Researchers could share code that they use to access the eCrime eXchange (eCX) API.<br>
<br>
More specifically, this is code written by members that they can run on their own systems to access the eCX API.<br> 
<br>
<h2>Access</h2>
This is a public repository where anyone can download and use the code. <br>
<br>
To gain access to contribute to an existing repository, or to submit to a new repository please email <a href="mailto:guhan@apwg.org">guhan@apwg.org</a>.<br>
<br>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
You can find documenation about the eCX API <a href="https://apwg.github.io/ecx-api-client/">here</a>.<br>
<br>
We also suggest you take a look the <a href="https://github.com/APWG/ecx-api-client">eCX API client</a> written by the developers at eCX. It is written in the PHP programming language.<br>
