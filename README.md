# eCrime eXchange (eCX) Code Repository

<h2>Overview</h2>
At the eCrime 2017 conference in Scottsdale, the APWG Steering Committee agreed to create a GitHub respository where APWG Members and Researchers could share code that they use to access the eCrime eXchange (eCX) API.<br>
<br>
More specifically, this is code written by members that they can run on their own systems to access the eCX API.<br> 
<h2>Access</h2>
This is a public repository where anyone can download and use the code. <br>
<br>
To gain access to contribute to an existing repository, or to submit to a new repository please email <a href="mailto:support@ecrimex.net">support@ecrimex.net</a>.<br>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
You can find documentation about the eCX API <a href="https://www.ecrimex.net/api">here</a>.<br>
<br>
We also suggest you take a look the <a href="https://github.com/APWG/ecx-api-client">eCX API client</a> written by the developers at eCX. It is written in the PHP programming language.<br>
<h2>Testing</h2>
We have a development machine/sandbox for the eCX API located at http://deployment.ecrimex.net for you to test your code on.  It is updated nightly at midnight GMT with new data from production. 
<br>
<h2>How to get your code listed here</h2>
