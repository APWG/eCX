# eCrime eXchange (eCX) Code Repository

<h2>Overview</h2>
At the eCrime 2017 conference in Scottsdale, the APWG Steering Committee agreed to create a GitHub respository where APWG Members and Researchers could share code that they use to access the eCrime eXchange (eCX) API.<br>
<br>
More specifically, this is code written by members that they can run on their own systems to access the eCX API.<br> 
<h2>Access</h2>
This is a public repository where <b>anyone</b> can download and use the code. <br>
<br>
If you would like your code listed here, please <a href="mailto:support@ecrimex.net">contact us</a>.<br>
<br>
We can:
<ul>
<li>Link to your code or</li> 
<li>Fork your respository here or</li>
<li>Create a new repository and set you up as a submitter or</li>
<li>We are open to your suggestions :)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Licensing</h2>
We leave this up to the code creator and contributors. Please check within the each code repository for the associated license. 
<br>
<br>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
You can find documentation about the eCX API <a href="https://www.ecrimex.net/api">here</a>.<br>
<br>
We also suggest you take a look the <a href="https://github.com/APWG/ecx-api-client">eCX API client</a> written by the developers at eCX. It is written in the PHP programming language.<br>
<h2>Testing</h2>
We have a development machine/sandbox for the eCX API located at https://api.sandbox.ecrimex.net for you to test your code on.  It is updated nightly at midnight GMT with new data from production. 
<br>

We are especially looking for development of the following modules: <br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/APWG/ecx-to-splunk">Pull data from eCX and export into Splunk</a></li>
